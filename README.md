# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project

In this project, I utilized SQL to run queries on a dataset related to COVID-19, focusing on key aspects such as:

- Cases
- Deaths
- Vaccinations
- Population data

The results from these queries were then used to create a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard provides visual insights into the data, allowing for in-depth exploration and analysis.

You can explore the dashboard through this link: [COVID-19 Dashboard on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldWideCovidDataIsights/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
