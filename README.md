#COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Project
In this project, I utilized SQL to run queries on a dataset related to COVID-19, focusing on aspects such as cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population data. 
The results from these queries were then used to create a comprehensive dashboard. The dashboard provides visual insights into the data and can be explored through this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldWideCovidDataIsights/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link.
